# 👋 Hi, I’m Santiago Chabert

Senior Full-Stack Developer & Team Lead from 🇺🇾 Uruguay  
I build **end-to-end web applications**: from scalable backend systems to polished, production-ready frontends.

## 🚀 About me

- 🧠 6+ years building **full-stack web applications** in production
- ⚛️ Strong experience with **React & Next.js** on the frontend
- 🏗️ Solid backend foundations: APIs, data modeling, background jobs
- 👥 Team Lead experience: mentoring engineers and shipping as a team
- ☁️ Cloud-native mindset (AWS, Docker, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code)
- 🌎 Remote-friendly, async-first, used to working with US & EU teams

I enjoy owning features **end-to-end**, collaborating closely with product and design, and turning real business problems into maintainable software.

## 🧩 What I enjoy working on

- Full-stack features: **API → UI → deployment**
- Frontend performance, UX polish, and maintainable component systems
- Backend APIs that are boring, predictable, and reliable
- Modernizing legacy systems into clean, usable products
- Improving team velocity without sacrificing code quality
